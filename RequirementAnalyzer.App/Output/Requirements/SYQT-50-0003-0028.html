[Charging],[Component_Protection],[Over_Temperature]</br>Test Objective: Confirm that the secondary and primary DTCs are cleared after AC plug-off<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>26763</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)Review][Requirement]</div>Temporary component protection errors which are only shortly present (e.g. Temporary overcurrent, temporary internal/output overvoltage), must not set directly a primary error entry. Preconditon is that the error is self healing during a charging session (e.g. short shut down of the charging moduels by function AnsteuerungLadegerät_AC/DC_Hochvolt) )and the charging session can be continued after short time (e.g. 100ms)
A primary error entry has to be set latest when the charging session can no longer be continued.</li>
<li><strong>26764</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SWQT (ENG.8)Review][Requirement]</div>A special diagnostic healing mechanism has to be implemented:
• An error is not healable, e.g. in case of a permanent shutdown of a charging module or of the whole charger because of several component protection events.
• For errors which are not healing because the corresponding enabling conditions are no longer fulfilled once the charging module or charger is off.
• For errors which have very specific enabling conditions, like the actual switch matrix configuration.
</li>
<li><strong>26765</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SWQT (ENG.8)][Information]</div>A healing mechanism could be: Charging plug removed and reconnected. Other healing mechanism have to be defined in accordance with BMW.</li>
