[],[],[]</br>Test Objective: When DCDC voltage is 9,5V(U_Thr1) or less when SEV_AKTIV is active, Degradation(Deg_1) is notified to BMW-SW,
When the DCDC voltage is 9,0V (U_Thr2) or less, the Disconnect (Deg_2) signal is output.
Also, confirm that U_Thr1 and U_Thr2 can be changed as Calib.<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>28652</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>The E-Fan Control Function is responsible to deactivate the E-Fan depending on the LvDCDC output voltage. The Function performs the following tasks

1. Measure the Output Voltage of the LvDCDC in ASIL B
2. If the Voltage drops below U_Thr1, a degradation to 0A shall be requested in QM
3. If the Voltage drops below U_Thr2, a deactivation of the E-Fan via the relay driver shall be requested in ASIL B
4. A re-activation of the E-Fan is only allowed when the Voltage exceeds U_thr3
5. A diganosis shall be performed on the E-Fan Deactivation to detect any errors with the shut-off path</li>
<li><strong>28654</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL shall ensure that  all the functions relevant for voltage dependent degradation or deactivation after Initialisation or a reset are active, before the E-Fan is activated.

Note: The Inrush-Current of 500 A for 5ms from E-Fan is excluded. The functions relevant for voltage dependent degradation are specified in the chapter "Degradation and Deactivation of E-Fan"

FTT: 0 ms
Safe State: disconnection of the load supply of  the E-Fan has been requested</li>
<li><strong>28655</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][partly accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>In case an error occurs with Degradation or Deactivation of the E-Fan during a reset, it shall be detected using a self test after the start up procedure is completed.

FTT: 10ms
Safe State: disconnection of the load supply of  the E-Fan has been requested</li>
<li><strong>28657</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL shall command a degradation (Deg_1) of the E-Fan to 0A via ILF, when the Signal  SEV_AKTIV (Sent from BMW_SW) is active and the Voltage between B+ and B-  is <9,5 V (U_Thr1).

Note: Tolerance for the Voltage measurement shall be considered. The Voltage between B+ and B- is the Output voltage of the LvDCDC

Calibratable Range: 8,5 V- 11 V, Step size 0,1 V</li>
<li><strong>28658</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL shall command the disconnection of the E-Fan from the load supply (Deg_2), when the Signal  SEV_AKTIV (Sent from BMW_SW) is active and the Voltage between B+ and B-  is <9,0 V (U_Thr2).

Note: Tolerance for the Voltage measurement shall be considered. The Voltage between B+ and B- is the Output voltage of the LvDCDC

Calibratable Range: 8,5 V- 11 V, Step size 0,1 V


FTT: 80ms
Safe State: disconnection of the load supply of the E-Fan has been requested</li>
