1.  during the normal running of the AKKS, i.e. when the target position of the AKKS is being set based on the input of the BMW Thermal Management SW (eTMC)
OR
2. during a Stop-Test Open, a System Check or Plant System Test</br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-2 Preconditions: Ignition ON and LIN Communication is correctly working</br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-3 Trigger: a blockade has to be detected (ST_BLK_AKKS_LIN=0x01)</br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-4 Input data: the following LIN Signals will be used as input data within the ambit of the Blockade reaction:
- ST_BLK_AKKS_LIN -----> for the detection of the blockade and of the removal of the blockade;
- ST_SMOT_AVL_PO_AKKS_LIN -----> for determining the current position of the flap</br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-5 Description of behaviour: During the movement of the flap towards a certain target position Ptarget_original (identified by the LIN Signal ST_SMOT_PO_AKKS_LIN=Ptarget_original), if an early blockade has been detected at the position Pblock (identified by the LIN Signal ST_SMOT_AVL_PO_AKKS_LIN=Pblock ) under the above mentioned conditions, then:
1. the flap will be moved 50 LIN-Steps away from the blockade position Pblock ---->ST_SMOT_PO_AKKS_LIN=Pblock - 50;
2. the flap will move again towards the original target position -----> ST_SMOT_PO_AKKS_LIN=Ptarget_original;
3. if during the step 2. no blockade has been detected AND the final position is ST_SMOT_AVL_PO_AKKS_LIN=Ptarget_original the blockade reaction has been successfully terminated;
4. in case during the step 2. a new blockade has been detected, then the steps 1. and 2. will be re-executed again until the the reaction can be declared as successfully terminated for a max. of 2 further attempts (total 3);
5. in case after the 3 attempts the blockade has been not shaked, i.e. 
ST_SMOT_AVL_PO_AKKS_LIN != Ptarget_original, then the blockade reaction has been unsuccessfully terminated and the DTC  DFC_RadShtPostTopBlk\DFC_RadShtPostBotmBlk for the AKKS1\2 will be set</br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-6 Timing Requirements:</br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-7 Output data: the output data of this functionality can be considered
1. the target position, speed and torque which are being sent during the blockade reaction;
2. the DTC DFC_RadShtPostTopBlk\DFC_RadShtPostBotmBlk which is set in case the procedure is unsuccessful </br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-8 Postconditions: after the blockade reaction the AKKS will be set:
- in case the procedure has been successfully executed in Normal Mode;
- in case the procedure has been NOT successfully executed in Stop-Mode </br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-9 Descriptions of exceptions:
AKKS1 is not mounted for SP21 car lines.</br></li><li>3.1.17.1.0-10 Dependencies and interactions: the main dependency and interaction is with the LIN Communication</br></li><li>3.1.17.2 Differences to CRS</br></li><li>3.1.17.2.0-1 xxx</br></li><li>3.1.17.3 Questions and Answers</br></li><li>3.1.17.3.0-1 xxx</br></li>
