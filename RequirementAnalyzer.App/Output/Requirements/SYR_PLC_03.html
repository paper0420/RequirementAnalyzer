1. Charging protocol via PLC interface
2. Internet service for backend client via PLC interface. (condition EVSE must allow internet service) (this is TBD with customer)
3. Diagnostic sevice for measurement purpose or PLC dumping ( we would need PLC interface with data link established )

Pansonic software should perform following activities to provide interface:
- PLC Chip initialisation (SPI based configuration)
- PLC firmware update (via HOST or via External FLASH connected to PLC CHIP) (Note: SW developer please contact SE for more detail)
- provision to update External FLASH with latest firmware and PIB (parameter in block) via HOST (hint. configure GPIO pins of qca chip)
- Establish physical link (communication with PLC chip via MME ethertype frames)
- Establish data link (communication possible via Ethernet Frames not specific to MME ethertype)

In normal operation, PLC chip should boot from External FLASH by configuring boot option via QCA GPIO. PLC chip shall be boot from HOST. 
under factory or production operation, PLC should provide choice for booting option.

</br></li><li>1.1.30.3.1.0-2 Preconditions: PLC Hardware available. Coding parameter configured to provide PLC interface.</br></li><li>1.1.30.3.1.0-3 Trigger: 
- coding parameter to provide PLC interface for CCU.
- sigPreparePLCHardware (00 disable, 01 enable)
- sigEstablishPLCDataChannel (00 Disable, 01 Enable) 
- PLC Matching state = unMatched</br></li><li>1.1.30.3.1.0-4 Input data: BMW SW interface</br></li><li>1.1.30.3.1.0-5 Description of behaviour:
- When Coding parameter request PLC interface, at initialisation CCU will init PLC Chip.
- Panasonic software prepare the PLC interface, when customer software request it by sigPreparePLCHardware (01 enable)
  - PLC interface preparation consist check if PLC chipset is turn-on(GPIO), check for firmware with PLC chip, 
	if (no firmware in qca chip)
		update it via HOST 
		reboot plc chip 
		check firmware version
	else
 		check firmware version
- PLC chip is ready with firmware, validated it by checking firmware version. after confrimation Declare Physical link establishment to customer software via stsPHYLink(00 nolink, 01 link established)
- Customer software request sigPreparePLCHardware (00 disable), deactivate PLC interface.

- When customer software request panasonic software to establish data link via sigEstablishPLCDataChannel (00 Disable, 01 Enable) following action to be performed.
	- perform SLAC (matching) processes  (success of this process PLC Matching state = Matched)
	- request customer software for toggle pilot line via sigToggleRequest
	- customer software should provide status after completing toggling process via stsToggleRequest
	- after the SLAC process is completed (exchange of NID, NMK with EVSE), PLC state should be assigned matched 	state
	- local PLC chip is configured with received NID and NMK to join AVLN (qualcomm logical network)
	- once local plc chip enter AVLN, panasonic software should declare establishment of Datalink via stsDLink (00 nolink, 01 link established)

- Customer software can report error in data link via sigDlink_Error, Panasonic software will terminate the data link and restart the matching (hint. process by a control pilot transition through state E detected by customer software)
- Customer software can request panasonic software to pause data link and enter a power saving mode. While being in this mode, the state will be kept to “Matched”.
- Customer software can request to terminate Data Link, in this mode link should be terminated and mode should be set as unmachted. New link will require restart matching process (SLAC).

</br></li><li>1.1.30.3.1.0-6 Timing Requirements:
Timing behaviour need to be decided.
- restirction 
-- minimium time between sigPreparePLCHardware and sigEstablishPLCDataChannel should be define (TBD: please provide timeout values configurable/calibratable)
-> update : no expectation from customer. We have to prepare for worst and take ISO15118-3 timing table with consideration the BMW Sw will consume some time.
-- minimium time to between request need to be define in general with plc interface (TBD: please provide timeout values configurable/calibratable) 
(hint. time = time need to perform request + QCA settling time + tolerance)
-> update : no expectation from customer. We have to prepare for worst and take ISO15118-3 timing table with consideration the BMW Sw will consume some time.</br></li><li>1.1.30.3.1.0-7 Output data: PLCCP Sw interface</br></li><li>1.1.30.3.1.0-8 Postconditions:
PLC interface is working.

Details for PLC circuit design consideration is not available.
CODICO supplier has provided some documents for PLC design consideration for Qualcomm Chipset which could be used to provide robust design.
