[Charging],[Component_Protection],[Error_Recording]</br>Test Objective: Confirm that Collective DTC (component) is registered as an error<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>26763</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)Review][Requirement]</div>Temporary component protection errors which are only shortly present (e.g. Temporary overcurrent, temporary internal/output overvoltage), must not set directly a primary error entry. Preconditon is that the error is self healing during a charging session (e.g. short shut down of the charging moduels by function AnsteuerungLadeger√§t_AC/DC_Hochvolt) )and the charging session can be continued after short time (e.g. 100ms)
A primary error entry has to be set latest when the charging session can no longer be continued.</li>
