[],[],[]</br>Test Objective: When the DCDC voltage is 10.5V(U_Thr3) or more for 20s(T1) or more, the Connect signal is output and the FAN Switch ON signal is output, otherwise,
It is confirmed that Disconnect (Deg_2) is output and E-FAN Switch OFF signal is output.<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>28652</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>The E-Fan Control Function is responsible to deactivate the E-Fan depending on the LvDCDC output voltage. The Function performs the following tasks

1. Measure the Output Voltage of the LvDCDC in ASIL B
2. If the Voltage drops below U_Thr1, a degradation to 0A shall be requested in QM
3. If the Voltage drops below U_Thr2, a deactivation of the E-Fan via the relay driver shall be requested in ASIL B
4. A re-activation of the E-Fan is only allowed when the Voltage exceeds U_thr3
5. A diganosis shall be performed on the E-Fan Deactivation to detect any errors with the shut-off path</li>
<li><strong>28658</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL shall command the disconnection of the E-Fan from the load supply (Deg_2), when the Signal  SEV_AKTIV (Sent from BMW_SW) is active and the Voltage between B+ and B-  is <9,0 V (U_Thr2).

Note: Tolerance for the Voltage measurement shall be considered. The Voltage between B+ and B- is the Output voltage of the LvDCDC

Calibratable Range: 8,5 V- 11 V, Step size 0,1 V


FTT: 80ms
Safe State: disconnection of the load supply of the E-Fan has been requested</li>
<li><strong>28660</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL shall stop the degradation or the deactivation of E-Fan, only when the Voltage between B+ and B-  is  >10,5 V (U_Thr3) for a continuous period of 20s (T1).

Note: Tolerance for the Voltage measurement shall be considered. The Voltage between B+ and B- is the Output voltage of the LvDCDC

Calibratable Range: 8,5 V- 11 V, Step size 0,1 V

Safe State: disconnection of the load supply of  the E-Fan has been requested</li>
