The System Check is being started by a Diag-Job and it will be executed separately for the AKKS1 and the AKKS2.</br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-2 Preconditions: LIN Wake-Up and INIT procedure successfully executed</br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-3 Trigger: triggers of the System Check are the StartRoutines :
- 0x31 01 A1 66 for the AKKS1
- 0x31 01 XX XX (TBC) for the AKKS2

Furthermore, we have 2 corresponding StopRoutines as well which will lead to the interruption of the System Check:
- 0x31 02 A1 66 for the AKKS1
- 0x31 02 XX XX (TBC) for the AKKS2</br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-4 Input data: the DID of the System Check sent by a diagnostic tester via UDS</br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-5 Description of behaviour: During the System Check a Stop-Test Closed will be started, soon after followed by a Stop-Test Open.
In case the StopRoutine is being sent via UDS, the SD</br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-6 Timing Requirements: please refer to the related SysR.s of the "Stop-Test Closed" and of the "Stop-Test Open"</br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-7 Output data: eventual errors occurring during the execution of the System Check, i.e. during the execution of the Stop-Test Closed\Open parts will lead to the raising of an error memory entry. In particular:
- in case of detected blockade and of unsuccessful blockade reaction the DTCs "DFC_RadShtPostTopBlk/DFC_RadShtPostBotmBlk" for AKKS1\2 will be set;
- in case the low\high Stop are being not recognized during the Stop-Test Closed\Open respectively, i.e. when the corresponding blockades have been not detected, then:
	- the DTCs DFC_RadShtPostClsdTop\DFC_RadShtPostClsdBotm will be raised in case the 	  low Stop during the Stop-Test Closed is not acknowledged;
	- the DTCs DFC_RadShtPostOpnTop\DFC_RadShtPostOpnBotm will be raised in case the 	  high Stop during the Stop-Test Open is not acknowledged; </br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-8 Postconditions: at the end of the System check the control of the AKKS functionality will be released back to the CCU Application SW ----> AKKS will be set to Normal Mode</br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-9 Descriptions of exceptions:
AKKS1 is not mounted for SP21 car lines.</br></li><li>3.1.13.1.0-10 Dependencies and interactions:
