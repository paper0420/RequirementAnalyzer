[Device_Control],[E_FAN],[FAN_SEV]</br>Test Objective: During DCDC charge,If the LVDC voltage is 9V (U_Thr3) or more during after startup(Sleep->Wakeup), E-FAN Relay=ON, otherwise E-FAN Relay=OFF. Also, if the LVDC voltage is 10.5V or higher for 20s when E-FAN Relay=OFF, output the FAN Switch ON signal and confirm that E-FAN Relay=ON.<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>28652</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>The E-Fan Control Function is responsible to deactivate the E-Fan depending on the LvDCDC output voltage. The Function performs the following tasks

1. Measure the Output Voltage of the LvDCDC in ASIL B
2. If the Voltage drops below U_Thr1, a degradation to 0A shall be requested in QM
3. If the Voltage drops below U_Thr2, a deactivation of the E-Fan via the relay driver shall be requested in ASIL B
4. A re-activation of the E-Fan is only allowed when the Voltage exceeds U_thr3
5. A diganosis shall be performed on the E-Fan Deactivation to detect any errors with the shut-off path</li>
<li><strong>28660</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL shall stop the degradation or the deactivation of E-Fan, only when the Voltage between B+ and B-  is  >10,5 V (U_Thr3) for a continuous period of 20s (T1).

Note: Tolerance for the Voltage measurement shall be considered. The Voltage between B+ and B- is the Output voltage of the LvDCDC

Calibratable Range: 8,5 V- 11 V, Step size 0,1 V

Safe State: disconnection of the load supply of  the E-Fan has been requested</li>
