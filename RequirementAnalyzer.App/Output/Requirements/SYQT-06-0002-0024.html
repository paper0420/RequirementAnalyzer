[Charging],[AC_Charging],[AC_Measurement_Accuracy]</br>Test Objective: LT4 current accuracy check(single phase L1)<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>23663</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][partly accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Information]</div>The CCU during the AC charging should ensure that the DC current is in the allowed ranges, that is depending on the variant:
- 17A for 3,5KW charger
- 33A for 7KW charger
- 52A for 11KW charger
- 52A for 15KW charger
- 70A for 22KW charger

For this safety function:
- The supplier should measure the DC current on LT4 within the specified range and accuracy and provide that measure to BMW SW.
-  The supplier should ensure that the DC current provided while AC charging is not greater than the allowed range and if it is then stop the AC charging.
-  If the AC charging is stopped, then the supplier should inform BMW SW. 

Note: It is assumed that no loads are present on LT5,LT7 and DC/DC.</li>
<li><strong>26563</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][partly accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The mean value (over last 10ms) of the current on line LT4 "H_I_LT4" has to be provided on the signal "LT4_I_Sig" with an accuracy corresponding to the specified ranges.


-80 < LT4_I_SIG < -40 : +/- 10%
-40 < LT4_I_SIG < 0     : +/- 4A 
0    < LT4_I_SIG < 40    : +/- 3A
40 < LT4_I_SIG < 80    : +/- 7%

Safe state: Qualifier is equal to "Signal invalid", LT4_I_Sig_qi equal to "Invalid"
FTZ: 50ms</li>
