new DBC in sprint.2219
https://asc-prod-ha-wig.bmw.com/svn/asc271/Projects/CCUP_BEV21/branches/CCUBEV21_2219/BMW/Doc/NK/PATCH_v1_EADBN-1710_220324_DBC_EAPC_DC_CAN.dbc

Note: new DBC is integrated in SW. 
In accordance with new draft CDV2, there is change in values of CAN identifiers of all messages.
a) change in CAN addresses for charger and CCU
b) change in PDU format (PF) values for all message types

*******</br></li><li>1.1.32.8.1.0-5 Description of behaviour:
During Chaoji-1 charging sequence, in "Version Negotiation" function module, 
Charger sends "Charger Protocol Version" message to CCU.
Vehicle (CCU) sends "Vehicle Negotiation Results" message to Charger.
Function Module	Contents of Parameter Group	Message type	Message content (short)
Version Negotiation	Charger Protocol Version	PV	CPV
	Vehicle Negotiation Results	PV	VPV


In TX phase (CCU to Charger), LIM-C shall provide the (write TX-signals via record) message-data to COM Adapter via RTE and similarly. COM receives the data from COM Adapter. Based on configuration at COM, COM transmits the data to lower layer and on DC-CAN.

In RX phase (charger to CCU), message is received by vehicle (CCU), RX-PDU is sent from CAN IF to upper layers (COM). RX-signals are received by LIM-C from ComAdapter via RTE interface.
