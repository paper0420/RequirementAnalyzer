As soon as:
the regular Stop-Test Closed has been started (see 'SYR_HMG66:AKKS - Stop Test Closed') AND
an applicable time interval has elapsed (currently agreed to 10 sec.)
the Plant System Test will start</br></li><li>3.1.19.1.0-4 Input data: 
1.concerning the LIN Signals we have the same LIN input data of the Stop-Test Closed and Open;
2. moreover, we have in input the flag "name_to_be_defined" which will be used for checking whether the Plant System Test has been already executed or not.</br></li><li>3.1.19.1.0-5 Description of behaviour: the Plant System Test consists in a Stop-Test Closed immediately followed by a Stop-Test Open;
the result of the Plant System Test, which can be read-out by the Diag-Job "STATUS_WERKSTEST_AKKS_RESET" (0x31 03 A1 68), is stored in a RAM Variable which will be initialized as follows:
0 ----> 'Plant System Test not started'
5 ----> 'Plant System Test running'
8 ----> 'Plant System Test terminated without errors'
9 ----> 'Plant System Test terminated with errors'
If one or more errors occur during the execution of the Plant System Test, one or more entries in the Error Memory will be raised. The conditions are the same ones which have been specified in the 'SYR_HMG69: AKKS - System Check'</br></li><li>3.1.19.1.0-6 Timing Requirements:
1. The Plant System Test will start after the elapsing of an applicable time after the end of the regular Stop-Test Closed---> currently such an applicable time has been agreed with BMW to be equal to 10sec.
2. Other timing constraints are related to the execution of the Stop-Test Closed\Open ----> check respectively SYR_HMG66/SYR_HMG67</br></li><li>3.1.19.1.0-7 Output data: output data of the Plant System Test are:
1. the Plant System Test Result which can be read-out by the Diag-Job "STATUS_WERKSTEST_AKKS_RESET" (0x31 03 A1 68);
2. DTCs which have been raised during the Stop-Test Closed\Open (see SYR_HMG66/SYR_HMG67)</br></li><li>3.1.19.1.0-8 Postconditions: at the end of the Plant System Test the control of the AKKS functionality will be released back to the CCU Application SW ----> AKKS will be set to Normal Mode</br></li><li>3.1.19.1.0-9 Descriptions of exceptions:
AKKS1 is not mounted for SP21 car lines.</br></li><li>3.1.19.1.0-10 Dependencies and interactions: main dependency and interaction is with the LIN Communication</br></li><li>3.1.19.2 Differences to CRS</br></li><li>3.1.19.2.0-1 xxx</br></li><li>3.1.19.3 Questions and Answers</br></li><li>3.1.19.3.0-1 xxx</br></li>
