Charging Profile and SAScheduleTupleID is calculated and provided by MGU to CCU. BMW SWC provides this data over RTE interface to PANA SWC and using the data, AC EIM charging sequence is processed from Power Delivery Request. In case of failure between CCU & MGU (example, performance timer expired or SOME/IP socket issues or memory issue), CCU shall switch to basic charging (controlled by BMW SWC).  

[Change in scope of CR 921 / current SYR] Supplier shall implement intermediate fallback solution for AC EIM.

Overview on fall back strategy:


https://asc.bmw.com/jira/secure/attachment/2533909/Fallback_Scenario.png


Referring to ISO15118-2 requirements,
[V2G2-297] The first SAScheduleTuple element in the SAScheduleListType shall be defined as default SASchedule. 
[V2G2-298] If the EVCC is not capable of comparing different SAScheduleTuple elements or comparison fails, the EVCC shall choose the default SAScheduleTuple according to [V2G2-297]. 

During charging session, if communication between CCU & MGU is not possible/or failed (such as Socket connection issue detected at CCU, Subscription not received by CCU, SOME/IP event is not acknowledged at CCU or Response not received from MGU to BMW SWC) is detected and due to which optimized Charging Profile and selected SAScheduleTupleId cannot be provided to Charging station in Power Delivery Request. 

In this case, CCU shall follow V2G-297 and V2G2-298 and shall continue charging session for AC EIM. Based on Qualifier value set by BMW SWC, PANA BSW should extract the first Schedule ID from ChargeParameterDiscovery Resp and send this back to the EVSE as selected SAscheduleID in Power Delivery Request.
Charging Profile is optional parameter in Power Delivery Request so it will not be send. </br></li><li>1.1.31.17.1.0-6 Timing Requirements:define by  ISO15118 (edition-1)</br></li><li>1.1.31.17.1.0-7 Output data:defined by ISO15118(edition 1)</br></li><li>1.1.31.17.1.0-8 Postconditions:AC EIM based charging session is established between EV and EVSE (w/o charging profile and with default SAScheduleId).</br></li><li>1.1.31.17.1.0-9 Descriptions of exceptions:NA</br></li><li>1.1.31.17.1.0-10 Dependencies and interactions:BSW (SCC, PLC, ETH, SPI), PANA Appl., BMW SWC, RTE</br></li><li>1.1.31.17.2 Differences to CRS</br></li><li>1.1.31.17.2.0-1 xxx</br></li><li>1.1.31.17.3 Questions and Answers</br></li><li>1.1.31.17.3.0-1 xxx</br></li>
