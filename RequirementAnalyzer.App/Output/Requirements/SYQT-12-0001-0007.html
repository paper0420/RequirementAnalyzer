<li><strong>14506</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>The subfunction "Zustandsmanagement" serves for managing the operating states of the "DC/DC" function: "Init", "Standby", "Buck", "Error" and "Crash". The respective active states are communicated to other functions. The respective operating mode adopted by the subfunction "Zustandsmanagement" corresponds with the operating mode of the "DC/DC" function. </li>
