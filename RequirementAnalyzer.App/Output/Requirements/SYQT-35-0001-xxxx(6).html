[],[],[]</br>Test Objective: When E-FAN Disconnect is abnormal, confirm that DTC registers.
Also, confirm the return.<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>28654</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL shall ensure that  all the functions relevant for voltage dependent degradation or deactivation after Initialisation or a reset are active, before the E-Fan is activated.

Note: The Inrush-Current of 500 A for 5ms from E-Fan is excluded. The functions relevant for voltage dependent degradation are specified in the chapter "Degradation and Deactivation of E-Fan"

FTT: 0 ms
Safe State: disconnection of the load supply of  the E-Fan has been requested</li>
<li><strong>28662</strong> - <div>[Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL must implement a cyclic shut-off path test for the disconnecting of the electric fan from the supply. 
In case an error is detected after the shut off path test, the Function Block SEV-CTRL shall send the value "True" over the Signal "E-Fan_CTRL_Failed" to BMW SW. This error shall not be erased or resetted after a change in driving cycle.


FTT: 500ms

Note 1: An example for an error could be welded contacts.  For diagnostic purposes, information regarding current consumption, voltage and speed of the electric fan is available via LIN
Note 2: CCU (BMW/Supplier) are neither responsible for the decomposition of signals (Current&Voltage) in QM(A) nor in ensuring the signal integrity.</li>
<li><strong>28663</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>If "Deg_2" can no longer be requested due to an error, this must be documented using an error memory entry.</li>
