[Charging],[Component_Protection],[Derating]</br>Test Objective: 
The maximum power shall be supplied for 10 seconds earlier than the basic power of 50 seconds.<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>6537</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][partly accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>During driving the DC/DC converter HV/LV must provide a maximum power of 3.9 kW for at least 10 s for the low voltage onboard electrical system power supply. 

The maximum power must be provided not earlier than 50 s, where the basic power in the meantime is not higher than 3.3 kW.

Boundary conditions:
Inlet temperature: <= 45 Â°C
LV voltage: 14 to 15.5 V</li>
