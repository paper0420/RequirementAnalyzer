[Charging],[14V_DCDC],[DCDC_SEV]</br>Test Objective: Confirm that the extended peak current is 16 seconds<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>28532</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][partly accepted][HWT (ENG.7/8)][Requirement]</div>During driving the DC/DC converter HV/LV must provide a maximum current of 250 A for at least 16 s for the low voltage onboard electrical system power supply. 

The maximum current must be provided not earlier than 3600 s, where the basic current in the meantime is not higher than 178 A.

Boundary conditions:
LV voltage: 10.5 to 14 V
maximum 2 times over lifetime</li>
<li><strong>28533</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][partly accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>During driving the DC/DC converter HV/LV must provide a maximum power of 3.5 kW for at least 16 s for the low voltage onboard electrical system power supply. 

The maximum power must be provided not earlier than 3600 s, where the basic power in the meantime is not higher than 2.5 kW.

Boundary conditions:
LV voltage: 14 to 15.5 V
maximum 2 times over lifetime</li>
