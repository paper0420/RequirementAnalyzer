A functional system requirement is a functionality of the system which is directly observable from the outside of the system (like functional behaviour, time behaviour, etc.) and described as a Use Case with a unique SYR-ID.

Note: If a requirement in the Customer Requirements Specification (CRS) is not described completely, input the missing attributes in the detailed description of the requirement. For functional System Requirements (SYRs), also called Use Cases, the input of description including brief description, trigger, input data, etc. is mandatory. 

Note: All customer requirements in CRS have to be analysed and mapped to SYRs. For clarification with owner of the CRS you can temporary use the sub-chapters “Differences to CRS” and “Questions and Answers” but in the final release clear judgement is mandatory.</br></li>
