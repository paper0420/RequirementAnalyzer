[Functional_Safety],[Functional_Safety],[Functional_Safety]</br>Test Objective: Confirm that recover after detect to abnormal voltage from accelerator pedal 1 and 2 output.<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>23777</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][partly accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The voltage value at acceleration pedal sensor 1 shall be sent as "FahrPedal_Signal_U1" with following accuracy:

<1V:   +/- 10mV
>1V:   +/- 1%

Safe state:
FahrPedal_Signal_U1_qi: Corresponding Qualifier is set to invalid, 
FahrPedal_Signal_U1: see reference architecture (last correct value) 
FTT: 40ms


Note: requirements for signal quality are defined in the chapter "Signal Quality".
Note: The Range checks of Acceleration sensor 1 with Short to Ground and short to Ubatt are part of BMW-SW.
