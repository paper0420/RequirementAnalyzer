[],[],[]</br>Test Objective: Check Shut Off Pass Test<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>28652</strong> - <div>[Not Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)][Requirement]</div>The E-Fan Control Function is responsible to deactivate the E-Fan depending on the LvDCDC output voltage. The Function performs the following tasks

1. Measure the Output Voltage of the LvDCDC in ASIL B
2. If the Voltage drops below U_Thr1, a degradation to 0A shall be requested in QM
3. If the Voltage drops below U_Thr2, a deactivation of the E-Fan via the relay driver shall be requested in ASIL B
4. A re-activation of the E-Fan is only allowed when the Voltage exceeds U_thr3
5. A diganosis shall be performed on the E-Fan Deactivation to detect any errors with the shut-off path</li>
<li><strong>28662</strong> - <div>[Changed][accepted][SYQT (ENG.10)SYIT (ENG.9)][Requirement]</div>The Function Block SEV-CTRL must implement a cyclic shut-off path test for the disconnecting of the electric fan from the supply. 
In case an error is detected after the shut off path test, the Function Block SEV-CTRL shall send the value "True" over the Signal "E-Fan_CTRL_Failed" to BMW SW. This error shall not be erased or resetted after a change in driving cycle.


FTT: 500ms

Note 1: An example for an error could be welded contacts.  For diagnostic purposes, information regarding current consumption, voltage and speed of the electric fan is available via LIN
Note 2: CCU (BMW/Supplier) are neither responsible for the decomposition of signals (Current&Voltage) in QM(A) nor in ensuring the signal integrity.</li>
