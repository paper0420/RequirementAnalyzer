Diagnostic Job DID 0x78E2 "ANALYSE_COP" will be added to ZEDIS v33 and newly implemented in Meta2217.
The new DID 0x78E2 can be triggered by Tester as routine 0x22 (Read Data By Identifier) 

Job Details are below:
DID-ID: 0x78E2
DID/RID Name: ANALYSE_COP
Name: STATUS_ANALYSE_COP 

The new DID 0x78E2 should always give positive response to tester with correct data 
A response with Condition Not Correct (CNC) to tester is not expected, since no dependencies with Plant/Field/Engineering Mode and speed_threshold.
The new DID 0x78E2 will read out 48x application XCP Measurement Signal values into respective 48x Job Argument Results


The list of all 48x Argument Results can be taken from the Diag Job Implementation Excel Sheet "Diag_Job_0x78E2_Analyse_COP.xlsx“, which is maintained in below MF SVN Link:

MF SVN:
 https://ccu-svn.microfuzzy.com/CCU_G26/SP21/SP21_SOP_2307/ENG.02_SystemRequirementsAnalysis/ENG.02_SystemRequirementSpecification/Req_Spec/Diag/Zedis_Export/ZEDIS_Extract_Analyse_COP/Diag_Job_0x78E2_Analyse_COP.xlsx


The interpretation of the relevant columns of in above referred Excel sheet is as follows:

Column A = Diagnoseauftragsnamen = Name of Diagnostic Job  
Column I = Arg/Erg Name = Name of Argument Result  
Column M = Datentyp = Datatype of Argument result (datatype of DCM Receiver Port)
Column N = Einheit = Unit of Argument results 
Column O = Label = Application XCP Measurement label, which value will be read out by DID 0x78E2
Column T = Min (minimal value, which Arg Result can have)
Column U = Max (maximal value, which Arg Result can have)
Column W = Application Layer of the data Sender Port (MF ASW or BMW Appl) 
Column X = If Sender Port existing 
Column Z = Datatype of Application Sender Port  
Column AD = Substitube XCP Calibration Variable 
Column AE = XCP Calibration Switch 
Column AF = Rx CAN/LIN Input BNE Signal
Column AG = Tx CAN/LIN Output BNE Signal
Column AH = PDU Name



Diag Job DID 0x78E2 will response to tester with same actual physical value of the repective XCP Measurement Label as per Column O.
For Tx Output BNE Signals, Tester should have the possibility to control the application sender Ports via xcp calibration Switches and Substitube XCP Calibration Variables.
For Rx Input Signals, Tester Tester should have the possibility to control the application sender Ports via Rx BNE Input Signals.
For DCDC related Signals, Tester should have the possiblity to control the application sender Ports via specific DCDC Usecases/Scenarios.
Tester should validate the triggered test value with XCP Measurement Label (in Column O) and with Diag_Job response.
If Control of Application sender Ports is not possible, Tester should only validate the measured actual value of the XCP Label (in Column O) with Diag Job Response. 
New Stub SW with additional XCP calibration variables to be created for ENG08 System Test purpose, to allow injecting values directly into BMW Apllication RTE Ports (30x BMW Signals)

Below 2x Exceptions must be considered:

Exception #1: Below 5x Argument Results will be filled with given dummy values in Diag_SWC

Argument Result Name	Expected Response (Dummy Value)
STAT_KRIECHMOMENT_UNGEFILTERT_WERT	0xFFFF
STAT_MAX_LADELEISTUNG_FAHRLADEN_WERT	0xFF
STAT_AKTUELL_ENTLADBARE_ENERGIE_HVS_WERT	0xFFFF
STAT_SOLL_POSITION_AKKS1_LIN_SCHRITTE_WERT	0xFFFF
STAT_SOLL_POSITION_AKKS2_LIN_SCHRITTE_WERT	0xFFFF


Exception #2: Below 3x Argument Results are not relevant for implementation and DCM Ports will remain unconnected. 

Argument Result Name	Expected Response 
STAT_SOLL_POS_GRAD_AKKS_1_HYBRID_WERT	0x00
STAT_SOLL_POS_GRAD_AKKS_2_HYBRID_WERT	0x00
STAT_STATUS_ANSTEUERUNG_AKKS_WERT	0x00

2) Diag_SWC
3) Diag_JP (ASW)
4) SLE SWC (ASW)
5) BMW Appl RTE Receiver Ports

• BSW E/E
- Port connections between Diag_SWC and Dcm will be established (45x Signals)
- Port Connections between Diag_SWC and Diag_JP will be established (10x ASW Signals)
- Port Connection between Diag_SWC and BMW Appl RTE R-Ports (30x BMW Signals)
- Data Conversion from physical value into code value as per Resolution table in ZEDIS SGBD file should be considered
- 5x BMW Signals will be filled with dummy values in Diag_SWC (4x given in Zedis and 1x missing BMW Appl Ports)
- New Stub SW with additional XCP calibration variables to be created for ENG08 System Test purpose, to allow injecting values directly into BMW Apllication RTE Ports (30x BMW Signals) 

• MF Application SW (ASW)
- New s/r Port to be created in Diag_JP and connected to SLE SWC (1x ASW Signal)
- Data Conversion from physical value into code value of all MF ASW Signals will be considered in Diag_JP as per given Zedis datatypes and resolution table (10x Signal) 
- ENG10 Testing must have the possibilty to calibrate all 10x ASW Signals, via XCP varibales or specefic test scenarios.
